# BonjourTomorrow

BonjourTomorrow is a small C# .NET application I built for IB Computer Science HL. It was my first time working with C# and .NET, but I found myself really enjoying the creative liberty afforded by the more freeform manner of user interface design that Visual Studio provides. It meant I could really focus on expanding the application's functionality, which is much more in line with my interests. This application is designed to assist the user in learning the French language by providing practice questions, tracking their progress as they answer things correctly, and providing options for rewards with progress made. The app is modular and functions on a codebase that employs techniques like error handling, JSON data handling, serialization of data for saving, and custom data files.
As part of the IB Computer Science process, I also wrote a 49 page design document for the program which documents the process of its conception, design, and implementation.
